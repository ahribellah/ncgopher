#+TITLE: NcGopher README

* ncgopher

=ncgopher= is a gopher client for the modern internet. It uses ncurses
and is written in Rust.

The software is still in alpha, and it is also my first application
written in Rust. Expect lots of bugs and badly written Rust code.

** gopher

Gopher was developed in 1991 at the University of Minnesota, and named
after the school's mascot. Gopher is a menu-driven interface that
allows a user to browse for text information served off of various
gopher servers.

** Installation

=ncgopher= has no fancy installation process right now. Clone the
repository, =cd= to the =ncgopher= directory and run

** Key bindings

During alpha, the keybindings are not configurable and many operations
are still not implemented.

|------------+--------------------------------|

** Debugging

If the application crashes, I'd be interested in a backtrace. Start
the application with ~RUST_BACKTRACE=1 cargo run~.  There is also a
debug view that can be activated with the =~=-key.
